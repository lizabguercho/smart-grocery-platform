# Finalize Change

## Purpose

Use this skill when the user asks to finalize completed repository work.

The workflow must always begin with a code review before any files are modified.

The agent is responsible only for:

- reviewing the change;
- classifying findings;
- deciding whether the workflow may continue;
- selecting an accurate changelog category and message;
- presenting results to the user.

Deterministic operations must be delegated to:

```bash
uv run python scripts/finalize_change.py <command>
```

Do not manually reproduce operations already implemented by the script.

---

# Approval Boundaries

Explicit user approval is required immediately before:

- creating a commit;
- pushing the branch.

These approvals are separate.

Approval to commit does not authorize pushing.

General instructions such as:

- “finish it”;
- “finalize everything”;
- “do the whole workflow”

do not replace the required commit and push confirmations.

No approval is normally required for:

- repository inspection;
- code review;
- Ruff formatting and automatic fixes;
- test execution;
- changelog updates;
- commit-message preparation.

Stop before those operations when the user explicitly requested approval before any file modification.

---

# Forbidden Actions

Never:

- review only after committing;
- commit before the review passes;
- commit directly on `main`;
- push directly from `main`;
- merge into `main`;
- force-push;
- bypass failing checks;
- remove or weaken tests merely to make checks pass;
- disable quality rules merely to make checks pass;
- invent changelog claims;
- stage or commit secrets;
- claim a command passed without executing it;
- treat commit approval as push approval.

If the deterministic script refuses an operation, report the reason and stop.

Do not bypass its safeguards.

# Workflow

## Phase 1: Review Before Modification

Read and follow:

```text
.cursor/skills/review-change/SKILL.md
```

Perform the complete review workflow described there.

The review must cover all current changes, including untracked files.

### When the review is blocked

If one or more blocking findings exist:

1. present the findings;
2. stop the finalization workflow;
3. do not run Ruff fixes;
4. do not update the changelog;
5. do not prepare a commit;
6. ask whether the user wants the blocking issues corrected.

### When the review passes

If no blocking findings exist:

1. summarize the review result;
2. continue to deterministic verification.

Do not ask the user to approve the review result unless clarification or a product decision is required.

---

## Phase 2: Deterministic Formatting and Verification

Run:

```bash
uv run python scripts/finalize_change.py verify
```

The script is responsible for executing configured deterministic operations, including:

```bash
uv run ruff check . --fix
uv run ruff format .
uv run pytest
```

If verification fails:

1. report the failing command;
2. summarize the actionable error;
3. stop;
4. do not update the changelog;
5. do not prepare a commit.

Do not mark verification as successful manually.

---

## Phase 3: Review Automatic Changes

Run:

```bash
uv run python scripts/finalize_change.py inspect
```

Inspect changes introduced by Ruff or other deterministic tooling.

Confirm that:

- automatic fixes are safe;
- formatting did not reveal or introduce an issue;
- no unintended files appeared;
- the final change still matches its intended scope.

This is not a complete second review unless the automatic changes were substantial.

If a new blocking issue exists, stop.

---

## Phase 4: Update the Changelog

Determine one concise changelog entry from the final diff.

The agent may decide only:

- the category;
- the message.

The script controls insertion and formatting.

Choose exactly one category:

```text
Added
Changed
Fixed
Removed
Security
```

The message must:

- describe an actual change;
- describe user-visible or contributor-visible behavior;
- be supported by the final diff;
- be written in the past tense;
- fit on one line;
- omit a final period;
- avoid low-level implementation trivia;
- keep the generated commit subject within 100 characters.

The commit subject is derived as `type(scope): subject`. If that form exceeds 100 characters, the script retries `type: subject`. If it still exceeds 100 characters, `prepare-message` refuses the entry.

Choose a shorter changelog message when the branch scope is long. Do not write a changelog line that cannot produce a commit subject of 100 characters or fewer.

Run:

```bash
uv run python scripts/finalize_change.py changelog \
  --category "<CATEGORY>" \
  --message "<MESSAGE>"
```

Do not edit `CHANGELOG.md` manually unless the script reports an invalid or unsupported changelog structure.

---

## Phase 5: Final Deterministic Check

Run:

```bash
uv run python scripts/finalize_change.py final-check
```

The command must validate:

- the active branch;
- repository state;
- changelog structure;
- forbidden files;
- Ruff checks;
- formatting;
- tests;
- commit readiness.

If it fails, report the failure and stop.

---

## Phase 6: Prepare the Commit Message

Run:

```bash
uv run python scripts/finalize_change.py prepare-message
```

The script deterministically derives a proposed commit message from repository state and the changelog.

The generated commit subject must be 100 characters or fewer. If the command fails for length, replace the Unreleased changelog entry with a shorter message and rerun `prepare-message`. Do not bypass the limit.

Do not replace the generated message merely because another wording is preferred.

A different message may be proposed only when the generated message is inaccurate or misleading.

Present the user with:

```markdown
## Ready to commit

**Branch:** `<branch>`

**Review:** Passed

**Verification:**
- Ruff check and automatic fixes: Passed
- Ruff formatting: Passed
- Tests: Passed

**Changelog:**
- `<category>`: `<message>`

**Proposed commit message:**

`<message>`

**Changed files:**
- `<file>`
```

Then ask:

> The change is ready. Should I create this commit?

Stop and wait for explicit approval.

---

## Phase 7: Commit After Approval

Only after explicit approval, run:

```bash
uv run python scripts/finalize_change.py commit
```

The script must:

- refuse protected branches;
- use the prepared message;
- stage eligible changes;
- reject forbidden files;
- create one commit;
- report the commit hash.

Report the resulting commit.

Then ask separately:

> The commit was created successfully. Should I push this branch?

Stop and wait for explicit push approval.

---

## Phase 8: Push After Separate Approval

Only after explicit push approval, run:

```bash
uv run python scripts/finalize_change.py push
```

The script must:

- refuse to push `main` or another protected branch;
- refuse to push a dirty working tree;
- push only the current branch;
- set its upstream when necessary;
- never force-push.

Report:

- the pushed branch;
- the remote;
- whether an upstream was created.

Do not merge the branch.

---

# Completion Report

At the end, state only actions that actually occurred.

Use:

```markdown
## Finalization complete

- Review: Passed
- Ruff: Passed
- Tests: Passed
- Changelog: Updated
- Commit: `<hash>` or Not created
- Push: Completed or Not performed

### Non-blocking observations

- None
```

Never describe a proposed commit or push as completed.
